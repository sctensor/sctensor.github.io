Saugata, with a Ph.D. in theoretical physics, brings a unique blend of academic prowess and corporate experience
to the tech arena. His journey, which includes delving into data analysis in astrophysics and pivotal roles at renowned
tech giants like Apple, Cisco, and Walgreens, provides a rich tapestry of skills and insights.

During his time in academia, where he served as a faculty advisor and adjunct faculty at ASU, Saugata discerned a
noticeable technology gap within academic leadership. While research in higher ed embraces innovation, the business side
often lags. Saugata observed the challenges of non-adoption of tech products due to resource constraints and varying
levels of industry experience among academic leaders.

Recognizing that commercial tech solutions, often tailored for the retail sector, came with substantial price tags,
Saugata is on a mission to bridge this gap. His vision is crystal clear: deliver tailored solutions for higher education
and businesses beyond the Fortune 500. He acknowledges the distinctive challenges and opportunities in these domains,
aiming to provide practical and impactful tech solutions.
